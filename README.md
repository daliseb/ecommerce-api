#  Sunset Grocery App, an E-Commerce API

# Objective:
This capstone focused on debugging, as well as using MySQL and insomnia to test. We had to modify an existing e-commerce application so rather than building from scratch, I worked within an unfamiliar codebase to identify and fix issues with product searching, product updates causing duplication, and UI constraints like maximum values on the website.
In addition to bug fixes, I made small improvements, such as updating the header color, to better understand how frontend styling connects to backend logic. This project strengthened my debugging skills, improved my confidence working with Spring Boot APIs, and gave me experience maintaining and improving real-world code.

# Personal Goals for This Capstone
This capstone was incredibly different from our past capstones. We were able to view the front and backend of a website/application. We did not have a lot of practice with Insomnia in class so I was excited to see first hand how the tests ran. This turned out to be my biggest challenge. My goal was to get more familiar with the testing process and act as a detective to figure out a solution. 

# Key Features & Improvements
---Frontend Enhancement ✎𓂃 ---
One of the things that I found the most interesting was changing the color of the website header and price. I decided to make this change because it pushed me to understand how the header was being styled and rendered within the project. I wanted to know “how”, I wanted to know where the color was coming from, I also wanted to personalize the website to feel more like something that I did. Especially since the code for this project was given to us. At first, it wasn’t obvious where the color was coming from, which required me to trace through the HTML structure and CSS rules rather than making assumptions. This change helped me better understand the project’s styling structure, including how CSS classes, layout positioning, and shared styles affect l components like the header. It also reinforced how the tiniest frontend changes often require careful navigation through multiple files, especially in an existing codebase! This was VERY cool!

In the pictures above, I am showing where I modified the color of my logo/header. Its straight forward when you know where to look!
