# Sunset Grocery App, an E-Commerce API

Objective:
This capstone focused on debugging, as well as using MySQL and insomnia to test. We had to modify an existing e-commerce application so rather than building from scratch, I worked within an unfamiliar codebase to identify and fix issues with product searching, product updates causing duplication, and UI constraints like maximum values on the website.
In addition to bug fixes, I made small improvements, such as updating the header color, to better understand how frontend styling connects to backend logic. This project strengthened my debugging skills, improved my confidence working with Spring Boot APIs, and gave me experience maintaining and improving real-world code.
